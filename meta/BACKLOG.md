# Framework backlog — Fable exit audit (2026-07-04, framework v0.25.0)

> **How to use this file.** This is the prioritized work list produced by a full-workspace audit
> before model handover. Every entry is self-contained: problem, evidence, suggested approach,
> effort (S ≤ ½ session, M ≈ 1 session, L = multi-session), and which meta-invariants (#1–#7 in
> the root `CLAUDE.md`) the fix must respect. Before starting any entry, read root `CLAUDE.md`
> (meta-workflows, definition of done) and `DEVELOPING.md` (command recipes). Ship via
> `.claude/scripts/release.ps1` when shipped behavior changes [#7]. Work P1s first; within a

> **Audit baseline:** all existing deterministic gates were GREEN at audit time — both repos'

## P1 — incorrect behavior or false safety claims on supported configurations

**All P1 items (B-01, B-02, B-03) shipped in v0.25.1 (2026-07-04) — see the Done section.** Two
follow-ons this band surfaced are folded into existing P2 entries: the Copilot postToolUse leg is
dead (feeds B-08 matrix rows + B-09 post-write demotion) and the folder-trust prerequisite feeds
`framework-doctor` (B-16). The B-01 optional guard hardening was deferred by decision (see Done).
**B-37 (post-ship review of v0.27.0) shipped in v0.27.1 (2026-07-16) — see the Done section.**

---

## P2 — gates that lie by omission (drift they were built to catch passes silently)

**All P2 items (B-04…B-09) shipped in v0.25.2 (2026-07-04) — see the Done section.** The
check-lockstep union/computed-skills/hooks.json gates + template-checks skills-mirror gate close
the silent-drift holes; the post-write $tn routing divergence is fixed with twin agreement tests;
the enforcement matrix gained the three missing capability rows. **B-35 (below, added 2026-07-15
from consumer feedback) is the one open P2 item.**

### B-35 · Derive, don't assume: the framework pushes EF Core on non-EF backends — **design LOCKED (WSD-020)**
**Effort:** M · **Invariants:** #1 #2 #3 #6 #7 · added 2026-07-15 · spec: `.claude/plans/2026-07-15-b35-derive-dont-assume-design.md`

**Problem (consumer-reported).** A dev team with a MongoDB backend reports the framework "goes
with EF Core… should have derived things from the codebase." Verified: (1) `boy-scout-check`
heuristic #3 flags `ToListAsync`-family calls without `AsNoTracking()` — MongoDB.Driver exposes
the same method names, so on Mongo the hook demands an EF-only API on every query file, pre- or
post-bootstrap; (2) `docs/defaults.md > Data Access` asserts EF Core unconditionally in the
cold-start window; (3) `/bootstrap` A2's detection list is closed ("EF Core / Dapper / both") —
a document store isn't representable, biasing even bootstrapped output; (4) `add-entity` walks
EF steps with no evidence gate; (5) shipped `copilot-instructions.md` hardcodes DbContext advice.

**Do:** implement the locked spec — one core "derive, don't assume" evidence-gating rule;
conditional defaults.md Data Access blocks (EF/Dapper/Mongo/none); open A2 detection + 3a
no-unevidenced-technology guard; add-entity Step 0 gate + 3a persistence audit line;
boy-scout heuristic #3 requires EF markers in-file (×4 twin/sibling files + fixtures);
genericize the copilot-instructions line. Candidate to ship as a v0.26.x defect fix before B-27.

**Not:** a MongoDB dist or stack; rewriting prose that uses EF Core as illustration; B-34.

---
## P3 — hygiene, drift, small fixes

**B-12 was already resolved — see the Done section.** No open P3 items remain from the audit;
post-audit P3 item B-29 (haiku adequacy evidence) is under "Known deferred work" (its sibling
B-30 shipped in v0.25.4). **B-34 and B-36 (below, added 2026-07-15) plus B-38 and B-39 (added
2026-07-16) are the open P3 items.**

### B-38 · release.ps1 is not re-runnable after a refused release (README stamp idempotency)
**Effort:** S · **Invariants:** #7 (process only — meta script, PS-only by decision, no shipped
behavior) · added 2026-07-16 (hit twice during the v0.27.1 release; recipe in `meta/LEARNINGS.md`
2026-07-16 §2)

**Problem.** `release.ps1`'s README version stamp (`.claude/scripts/release.ps1` ~line 63)
FATALs when the regex replace changes nothing, to protect against the line being reworded. But
`[regex]::Replace` also changes nothing when the line exists and **already carries the target
version** — which is exactly the state a *refused* release leaves behind (stamping happens in
step 2, gates run in step 4). So the natural workflow "gate fails → fix the cause → re-run the
same command" dies with a misleading `FATAL: README.md has no 'Current shipped version' line`,
and the maintainer must hand-revert the README line first. Cost two extra runs on 2026-07-16
(the refusal itself was legitimate — `no-meta-leak` caught a tracking id in a shipped test).

**Do (plan).**
1. Separate "line missing" from "line already stamped": `[regex]::Match` the version-line
   pattern first — FATAL **only** when there is no match (reword protection stays); when the
   matched version already equals `$Version`, skip the write and print
   `README already stamped $Version (retry after a refused release).`; otherwise replace+write
   as today.
2. Audit the remaining stamp steps for the same class — they are already idempotent (CHANGELOG
   `Unreleased` stamp is conditional; CLAUDE.md/framework-version.json replaces converge; step 5
   already exits cleanly on "nothing to commit") — assert that in the PR description, don't
   restructure them.
3. On refusal (both `Release REFUSED` exits), print one line telling the maintainer the command
   is safe to re-run as-is once the gate is fixed.
4. Verify red/green without a full release: copy README to a temp file and drive the stamp
   logic's three states (already-stamped → proceeds; older version → rewrites; line deleted →
   FATAL). Full-loop confirmation happens for free at the next refused release; note the result
   in LEARNINGS then.

**Not:** making the gates themselves resumable/checkpointed (they're fast enough to just re-run
— see B-39); touching anything shipped.

### B-39 · Gate-battery runtime: parallelize the per-dist hook suites in release.ps1
**Effort:** S (phase 1) · **Invariants:** #7 (phase 2 only) · added 2026-07-16 (measured on the
maintainer box, pwsh 7, during the B-37 session)

**Evidence (2026-07-16).** Serial gate battery in `release.ps1` ≈ **6 min wall**: hook suite
≈ 105 s **per dist** ×3 (dotnet 106 s / angular 104 s / monorepo 105 s), meta suite 21 s,
compose ~1 s and validate-dist ~3 s per dist. CI wall ≈ 6.5 min (windows leg 6 m 22 s is the
long pole; linux 3 m 35 s). Per-file hot spots (dotnet): `TwinParity` 44 s (40 tests),
`WikiCheck` 26 s (13 tests — each runs both twins), `Guard` 15 s (34 tests). The cost is child
`pwsh`/`bash` **process spawns per test** — that is by design (the spawned child *is* the honest
test surface; do not in-process it) — so the win is concurrency, not per-test surgery.

**Assessment.** ~6 min per release is tolerable in isolation but compounds: active days ship
multiple releases (three release.ps1 runs on 2026-07-16 alone ≈ 18 min of gates), and every
refused release doubles its cost. A process-level parallelization is cheap and honest.

**Do (phase 1 — meta-only, no version bump).** In `release.ps1`, run the three per-dist gate
pairs (validate-dist + hook suite) as three concurrent child processes (`Start-Process`/jobs),
collect exit codes, gate on all three. Suites are independent (separate dist trees, per-test
GUID temp dirs). Expected release gate wall ≈ 6 min → ~2.5 min (capped by one dist suite +
meta suite). Keep output legible: buffer per-dist logs and print them sequentially.

**Do (phase 2 — optional, shipped change, needs a version).** Teach the shipped
`tests/hooks/Invoke-HookTests.ps1` runner to execute its `*.Tests.ps1` files as bounded
parallel **child processes** (cap ~4). Per-dist wall ≈ 105 s → ~45 s (capped by TwinParity),
and consumer CI gets the same win. Constraint discovered in B-37: `_HookHarness.ps1`'s
`Invoke-Hook` mutates process-global `[Console]::OutputEncoding`, so in-process runspace
parallelism is **unsafe** — parallelize at process granularity only. Ship only when a release
is happening anyway; measure before/after in the changelog.

**Not:** rewriting tests to avoid child-process spawns (the spawn is the test); splitting
TwinParity (single-file cap is acceptable); CI runner-size changes.

### B-36 · Testing strategy: suite-bootstrap mode + per-item strategy rail — **design LOCKED (WSD-020)**
**Effort:** M · **Invariants:** #1 #2 #6 #7 · added 2026-07-15 · spec: `.claude/plans/2026-07-15-b36-testing-strategy-design.md`

**Problem.** Per-item testing doctrine is substantially present (workflow rails, Test shape
heuristic, add-tests level decision + characterization mode, leanness #11–16, test-critic) —
but three gaps: (G1) a repo with **zero tests** has no path — `add-tests` Step 1 is "find the
existing pattern first", so there's nothing to mirror and no recipe creates the harness, wires
CI, or orders first tests by risk; the Refactor rail's "characterization tests first" is
unexecutable there; (G2) the Feature rail says "test strategy" without pointing at the decision
procedure; (G3) bootstrap never writes a repo-specific *target test shape* nor converts "no
tests found" into a routed action. The meta-framework side has no gap (definition-of-done per
artifact type + hook harness — audited, adequate).

**Do:** implement the locked spec — `add-tests` gains **Suite bootstrap mode** (confirm
framework with developer → scaffold minimal unit + integration harness → wire into CI →
risk-first initial tests: hazard areas / financial invariants / critical journeys → one honest
TECH_DEBT backfill entry) across all three stacks; Feature rail gets a one-line pointer to the
Test shape heuristic + suite-bootstrap escape hatch; bootstrap A5/A6 reports suite absence as a
primary finding, 3a writes a target-test-shape line, 3b/Phase-4 route the fix; one routing line
in defaults.md > Testing.

**Not:** coverage thresholds / mutation testing (deferred by earlier decision — don't
resurrect); E2E tooling selection; new skills or commands; meta-framework changes.

### B-34 · Rendered-output twin parity: guard + audit-trail (the hooks B-32's fixtures don't cover)
**Effort:** S–M · **Invariants:** #1 #3 #5 #7 · added 2026-07-15 (found during B-32 implementation)

**Problem.** The B-32 fixture work proved the `.ps1` hook twins render *different model-visible
text* than their `.sh` twins — the `.ps1` side was written ASCII-safe (`WARNING:`/`--`) while the
`.sh` side uses the house style (`⚠`/`—`/`→`). Invariant #3 promises identical behavior; the hook
suites test decisions/robustness, never rendered content (exactly the M5 gap named in the B-32
spec). session-start + route-prompt were aligned and gated in v0.26.5 (B-32's twin-render fixtures
now FAIL on drift there). **guard and audit-trail remain unswept**: grep evidence 2026-07-15 —
`guard.sh` 16 unicode-bearing lines vs `guard.ps1` 11; `audit-trail.sh` 4 vs `.ps1` 0 (some are
comments; nobody has diffed the *rendered* output).

**Do:** render-diff each remaining twin pair (`guard`, `audit-trail`, and the per-stack
`post-write` files under `src/stacks/*/files/`) across their existing test fixtures
(`tests/hooks/_fixtures/` patterns), byte-compare stdout/stderr per surface shape [#5]. Align
divergent rendered strings to the `.sh` canonical, sweep stack snippets/siblings [#1], update any
tests pinning old strings, rebuild dists. Ship via release.ps1 [#7]. Consider extending the B-32
fixture set to these hooks in the same pass (they're cheap once fixtures exist — but note guard's
output is *stderr + JSON deny shapes*, not plain rails, so the fixture capture differs).

**Not:** wording changes; the `.sh` content is canonical, this is formatting-parity only.

### B-33 · Make the archived legacy repos route an *agent* to the merged repo — **DONE 2026-07-12, see Done section**

**Why:** consumers adopt this framework by pointing an LLM at a repo URL and saying "install this
into our repository". For 25 versions those URLs were `ai-tech-lead-dotnet` and
`ai-tech-lead-angular`, whose READMEs opened with §1 *"For AI agents (LLMs)"*. Both are now archived
(read-only) with pointer READMEs. **Nobody has verified those pointers work on the audience that
actually uses them** — an agent, not a human. If a pointer README is a human-voice "this repo has
moved" line with no agent-addressed instruction, an agent told to install from the old URL will
either install the **frozen v0.25.5 template** it can still see in the tree, or improvise. Old URLs
are plausibly still the *majority* of inbound traffic.

**Do:** read both pointer READMEs (they could not be verified from the maintainer's box — local
clones are frozen at `bd8bb2f`, the pointers were added on GitHub). If they do not tell an agent, in
imperative voice, to go to `andreoucostas/ai-tech-lead` and install from `dist/<stack>/` — and to
**not** install what it finds in the archived tree — then: unarchive → fix → re-archive. Both repos.

**Not:** any other change to the legacy repos. They stay frozen at v0.25.5.

**Evidence trail:** v0.26.3 (2026-07-12), `meta/LEARNINGS.md` — "a merge can preserve every artifact
and still retire the entrypoint they were reached through". This is the same defect class, on the
one door that could not be fixed from here.

---

## Known deferred work (previously agreed, converted to entries so it survives handover)

**B-14 shipped in v0.25.3 (2026-07-05) — see the Done section.**

### B-15 · WS-3: one *verified* Jenkins/Bamboo required-build recipe (P1 of the self-sufficiency roadmap)
**Effort:** M–L
Consumers are Bitbucket Data Center shops; the only deterministic outer-loop primitive they can
use without a DC admin is a **required-build merge check** running their existing CI. Ship one
recipe (docs + pipeline file) that runs `docs-sync-check` + build + test + lint. "Verified"
means actually executed against a local Jenkins container with evidence, per the workspace
verification rules. Details: `.claude/plans/2026-07-02-self-sufficiency-forensic-review.md`
(WS-3). Pre-receive hooks / Code Insights: rejected there — do not resurrect without a consumer
request.

### B-16 · WS-4: honest `framework-doctor` (P1 of the self-sufficiency roadmap)
**Effort:** M
Consumers can't tell which enforcement tier is live (Preview hooks off = silent degradation;
`guard.sh` without jq/python3 = loud warning nobody reads — WSD-006). Ship a doctor with three
honest tiers: verified-present (reuse `template-checks`, don't reimplement), verified-absent,
and **cannot-verify-from-a-script** (the Copilot org-policy hook toggle — print a
paste-into-agent-mode canary prompt the developer observes). Include the surface-choice
guidance (guard works today on GA Copilot CLI — cheapest coverage win, finding F9 in the WS
plan). Maintainer meta-checks stay out of the shipped doctor.

### B-17 · WS-5: scoped instruction delivery for test files
**Effort:** M
`.github/instructions/` files with `applyTo: **/*Tests.cs` / `**/*.spec.ts` carrying the
test-integrity rules — highest marginal salience, works today with Preview hooks off. Generated
by `/generate-copilot`; extend the `template-checks` mirror gate in the same task [#2]. No
`applyTo: **` variant (decided — salience dilution).

### B-18 · WS-6: opt-in git-hook convenience net
**Effort:** M
`scripts/setup-git-hooks.ps1/.sh` (+ `install.ps1 -GitHooks` flag), added-lines-only staged
scan reusing guard's patterns; must detect and refuse on existing `core.hooksPath`/husky;
documented as bypassable convenience, **not** enforcement. Silent default wiring was explicitly
rejected — keep it opt-in.

### B-20 · Coverage-as-diagnostic + diff-scoped mutation testing (the former v0.24.0 testing release)
**Effort:** L · needs a **new version slot** — ≥ v0.28.0 (0.26.0 = merge, 0.27.0 = B-27 per WSD-012)
Execution-ready plan exists: `C:\Users\Costas\.claude\plans\v0_24_0-shipped-framework-testing.md`
(WS-T9 coverage holes-map + optional off-by-default patch-coverage gate, roll-your-own diff
coverage over `scripts/metrics.*` cobertura ∩ `git diff`; WS-T10 Stryker.NET `--since` /
StrykerJS `--incremental`; WS-T11 wire survivors into `test-critic`; WS-T12 docs/parity).
Key traps recorded there: Angular needs a cobertura reporter wired; CI must fetch the base ref;
"CI-enforced" = runs+reports by default, only the opt-in floor blocks.

### B-21 · Reviewer-profile systemic fixes — **DONE (shipped v0.28.0, 2026-07-16) — see Done section**
**Effort:** M–L · **P0 design complete 2026-07-06** (WSD-013) · **Invariants:** #1 #3 #4 #5

> **Design LOCKED — do not re-derive.** Full spec (adversarially critiqued, LOCK WITH
> AMENDMENTS, findings folded): **`.claude/plans/2026-07-06-b21-reviewer-profile-design.md`**;
> decision record **WSD-013**. Implement from that doc **post-merge, ≥ v0.28.0**, as single
> `src/core` edits in the merged repo; independent of B-27. Frozen under WSD-012's shipped-work
> freeze until the merge lands.

Consumers are competent engineers with limited AI understanding; the pipeline must make every
AI-architecture call so reviewers only answer plain questions about their own code. The design
found the original framing partly stale (adopt-4a contradiction prompts + bootstrap 3d-bis plain
hazard questions already shipped) and re-scoped to the residual gap — judgment items scatter and
expire silently. Three fixes: **D1** a prioritized "needs a human decision" checklist into the
PR/commit (bootstrap Phase 4 + adopt Phase 8, single-emitter, durable `<!-- DEFAULTED -->`
marker for adopt-4a); **D2** session-start hazard-staleness resurface (real interval math,
ISO-pinned, inside `$body`/`emit_body`); **D3** rendered legend + "merge ≠ verified" line, ladder
tokens kept. The remaining backlog work is the implementation (M–L).
**Implementation checklist addition (2026-07-11, WSD-017):** while editing the report emitters,
sanity-check each report's verbosity against the reviewer profile — output leanness applies only
where it doesn't cost the plain-engineering explanations the profile requires (WSD-013). No
standalone "output leanness" backlog item exists, by decision.

### B-22 · Headless `/adopt` — **P0 design DONE (Path A); implementation post-merge**
**Effort:** L · **P0 design complete 2026-07-06** (WSD-014) · **Invariants:** #1 #3 #5 #7

> **Design LOCKED — do not re-derive.** Full spec (adversarially critiqued — verdict RETHINK,
> resolved as **Path A**; findings folded): **`.claude/plans/2026-07-06-b22-headless-adopt-design.md`**;
> decision record **WSD-014**. Implement **post-merge, ≥ v0.28.0**, as single `src/core` edits;
> **depends on B-21 D1** (sequence with or before). Frozen under WSD-012 until the merge.

Agent-runnable, non-interactive adoption. The critique proved the non-negotiable prompt-injection
boundary (constraint 2) forbids auto-merging untrusted content into `CLAUDE.md`; the maintainer
chose **Path A** — headless **prepares** adoption autonomously (branch, archive, provenance +
adversarial screen, impact baseline) and **stages** every proposed CLAUDE.md/TECH_DEBT merge for a
**human to apply at PR review**. Invocation reuses the read-and-execute-the-workflow prompt pattern
(`--headless` directive; both Claude Code + Copilot CLI; `disable-model-invocation` stays). Embedded
Phase-7 `/bootstrap` runs headlessly (3d-bis → all hazards `[UNVERIFIED]`). Composes with B-21 D1.
The remaining backlog work is the implementation (L).

### B-23 · Evals as a release gate
**Effort:** M
`tests/evals/run_evals.py` has never gated a release. Wire `release.ps1` to *prompt* to run it
(human-triggered — API cost), and record per-version results in `docs/eval-results.md`.
Related open question: `tests/` including `tests/evals/` **ships to consumers** via the
installer (verified 2026-07-01, accepted-for-now) — revisit whether evals should be excluded
from the consumer install.

### B-25-EXEC · Execute the monorepo merge (Phases 0–6 of MERGE-MIGRATION-PLAN.md)
**Effort:** L (5–7 focused sessions) · **Invariants:** all — this task retargets them · added 2026-07-06
· **IN PROGRESS since 2026-07-08 — Phases 0–3 COMPLETE.** Phase 0: freeze ON, `freeze-v0.25.5`
tags pushed (fidelity baseline: dotnet `bd8bb2f`, angular `e0f7782`), filter-repo verified,
`ai-tech-lead` repo created (private). Phase 1: both repos filter-repo'd into `legacy/{dotnet,angular}`,
merged (`--allow-unrelated-histories`, zero conflicts) → merge commit `305d69e`, 276 files, history
preserved, tagged `pre-restructure`, pushed (branch = `master`). Phase 2 COMPLETE (`218acac`):
classification reproduced WSD-012 (51 identical / 77 differing / 10+10 stack-only), twin extraction
done, **138/138 reproduced for both dist stacks, mismatch=0/missing=0/extra=0** — zero-behaviour-change
proof for both single-stack dists. **Phase 3 COMPLETE 2026-07-09 (`6acb8e5`, pushed;
independently re-verified by Fable first):** `build.ps1` composer twin (byte-identical to `build.sh`
across PS 5.1 + pwsh 7 × both stacks; pwsh 7.3 `-split` trap found+fixed), STRICT fidelity twins
(missing fails; allowlist EMPTY — 138/138 with no exclusions), `validate-dist` twins (marker/JSON/
bash -n/PS-AST/per-dist template-checks; red-tested ×4 defect classes), golden `dist/` committed
(`linguist-generated`), CI (`ci.yml`: rebuild+diff freshness, validate, fidelity, hook suites ×2 legs),
thin root installer wrappers delegating to the frozen dist installers (9-scenario smoke matrix).
**Phase 4 COMPLETE 2026-07-10 (WSD-015):** `dist/monorepo` (148 files) composes via
concat-by-default + authored-override + collision-error (111 authored snippets, 38 whole-file
overrides, 5 derived markers); D4 token gate 1.17× (no fallback); hook union + post-write dispatch
fixture-proven on 3 hosts (the `.ps1` sensitive-regex was NOT additive-safe — authored `-or`
merge, see LEARNINGS); installers auto-detect mixed→monorepo (smoke-tested both legs); validate-dist
green ×3, fidelity 138/138 ×2, hook suites 0 failures ×3, composer twins byte-identical ×3 hosts;
CI gained monorepo legs. **Phase 5 COMPLETE 2026-07-11 (WSD-016):** D7 executed — governance
layer (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/DEVELOPING.md, rewritten single-repo; invariant #1 → single-source
composition) + bom-fix twins (rescoped `ai-tech-lead-*` → `ai-tech-lead/`, twin-agreement tested
9/9) + meta suite (WorkspaceBom now repo-wide; `-File` trap: snippet dirs are *named* `*.ps1`) +
BACKLOG/workspace-decisions/plans/LEARNINGS all moved into the merged repo; `check-lockstep` +
its tests retired; `release.ps1` retargeted (one stamp/CHANGELOG; gates = compose ×3 +
validate-dist ×3 + hook suites ×3 + meta suite; fidelity deliberately NOT a release gate);
root README + root CHANGELOG (v0.26.0 Unreleased) + legacy changelog freezes (diff-verified);
CI gained the meta-suite leg; workspace root reduced to a pointer stub. Verified: build ×3 +
dist freshness empty, validate-dist ×3 exit 0, fidelity ×2 exit 0 (dist untouched), meta suite
0 failures. **Next: Phase 6** (validation → archive legacies → tag v0.26.0 — the release must
retire/re-baseline the CI fidelity legs + fold the checkout v4→v5 bump). See WSD-012 deltas.
Post-freeze follow-up: bump `actions/checkout` v4→v5 (GitHub Node 20 deprecation notice) in the
**shipped** workflows (`src/core/.github/workflows/template-ci.yml` + `docs-sync-check.yml`, and
thereby `dist/`) at the first release that deliberately changes shipped content (≥ v0.26.0) — they
are fidelity-frozen until then. The authoring repo's own `ci.yml` was bumped 2026-07-09.
**Phase 6 COMPLETE — v0.26.0 SHIPPED 2026-07-12 (WSD-018); B-25-EXEC DONE.** Validation ran green
(deterministic gates; all installer stack-resolution paths + `docs-sync-check` — real-toolchain
re-run against `dotnet new webapi` / `ng new` / a real mixed repo after the maintainer installed
dotnet 8.0.422 + ng 21; monorepo `route-prompt` overlay both stacks both twins; per-stack exemplar
routing dynamically confirmed disjoint — `.cs` under `api/`, `.ts` under `web/`). Release execution:
`actions/checkout` v4→v5 in the shipped workflows, CI strict-fidelity legs retired, v0.26.0 CHANGELOG
(root + 3 shipped stack changelogs), released via `release.ps1` → `ad717c7` (11/11 gates green; the
first run correctly REFUSED — the shipped changelogs weren't stamped — fixed then green). `master`
+ tag **v0.26.0** (`dcca7dd`) pushed; pointer READMEs on both legacy repos (dotnet `f018085`,
angular `433f258`); **both legacy GitHub repos archived** (`isArchived:true`). Evals deliberately
skipped for this release (not a gate, zero-behaviour-change, Anthropic-key-only harness — feeds
B-23); full interactive `/bootstrap` stays developer-gated. Acceptance 1–6 met; abort rule never
fired. **Next: B-27 (team wiki memory) as v0.27.0 in this repo.**

The decision half is DONE: D1–D7 signed off 2026-07-06 (**WSD-012**), plan refreshed against
v0.25.5 with fresh evidence, phase reorder (archive/tag only after Phase 6 validation), a
binding **abort rule**, and the fidelity baseline pinned to Phase-0 freeze tags. Execute
`MERGE-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` exactly — do not re-derive; deltas get appended to WSD-012.
**Phase 0 first** (freeze both repos + record freeze-tag SHAs). **Freeze scope:** while this
runs, all shipped-repo backlog items (B-15…B-23, B-29) pause; meta-only design work
(B-21/B-22 P0 design docs, WSD entries) remains allowed. First merged version **v0.26.0**;
B-27 follows as v0.27.0 in the merged repo.

### B-26 · Accepted-debt watch list (no action unless symptoms appear)
- `route-prompt` keyword-grep intent classification is brittle by design (accepted 2026-07-01);
  revisit only with evidence of misrouting.
- CLAUDE.md §1 rails reach the model up to 3× per prompt on Claude Code (CLAUDE.md +
  session-start + route-prompt) — token cost accepted for salience. **The "re-measure if
  context budgets tighten" trigger fired 2026-07-11** (consumer token-cost consciousness);
  the watch item is superseded by **B-32** (context-footprint gate, design LOCKED — WSD-017),
  which makes the re-measurement permanent. The salience-over-bytes trade itself stands.

### B-29 · Haiku-tier agent adequacy evidence (P3)
**Area:** both repos' `tests/evals/` · **Effort:** M · **Invariants:** #1 · added 2026-07-05

The v0.8.0 model-routing entry claims the haiku downgrade of `convention-check`, `bloat-radar`,
and `debt-radar` comes "without losing security or bootstrap quality" — that claim has never
been evidenced (no eval covers these agents; evals have never gated a release, B-23). Add eval
cases with planted defects each agent must catch on Haiku: known convention violations for
`convention-check`, over-abstraction patterns for `bloat-radar`, seeded TECH_DEBT references for
`debt-radar`. Mirror to both repos [#1]. If Haiku misses at a meaningful rate, revisit the
tiering (WSD-011) rather than the eval. Cross-links: B-23 (evals as release gate), WSD-011
(token-policy record that filed this gap).

**Amended 2026-07-11 (B-32 design pass, WSD-017):** rising consumer token-cost consciousness
raises this item's value — it is the enabler for safely *extending* the WSD-011 tiering to more
agents (the cheapest cost lever available; extension without evidence would repeat the original
unevidenced claim). Scope addition: decide/verify whether the shipped `.github/agents/*.agent.md`
wrappers should pin GitHub's documented `model:` field — tiering currently reaches Claude Code
only (WSD-011 implementation fact), so the Copilot half of every consumer surface gets no benefit.
A wrong pin is consumer-visible: verify on a live Copilot surface before shipping.

## Done

- **B-21 (implementation)** — shipped **v0.28.0** (2026-07-16). Implemented the LOCKED WSD-013
  design (`.claude/plans/2026-07-06-b21-reviewer-profile-design.md`) via a codex (gpt-5.6-sol)
  implementer under principal-engineer review. **D1** — `bootstrap.md` Phase 4 + `adopt.md` Phase 8
  emit a prioritized "Paste this into your PR (or commit message)" judgment checklist (INFERRED
  conventions / unsure-or-tooling-only hazards / adopt-4a defaulted contradictions / discovered
  skills); bootstrap suppresses under `/adopt` (Phase 8 sole emitter via the Phase-2b adopt signal),
  bootstrap gains a commit/PR nudge, adopt-4a writes a durable `<!-- DEFAULTED: … -->` marker that
  Phase 8 re-scans. **D2** — `session-start.{ps1,sh}` (core twins) resurface hazard rows whose ISO
  `Reviewed` date is >90 days old (interval math, GNU-`date` guard, inside `$body`/`emit_body` for
  the Copilot surface); `bootstrap.md` 3d-bis pins `Reviewed` + the not-a-hazard status to ISO
  `YYYY-MM-DD`. **D3** — rendered ladder legend + "merging the PR does not confirm these" above the
  hazard table (was inside a non-rendering HTML comment); ladder tokens kept as machine anchors.
  **Structural correction** (see LEARNINGS 2026-07-16): the pre-merge spec's "one `src/core` edit
  per artifact" was stale — bootstrap.md/adopt.md/FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md are stack whole-file overrides,
  so this was a ×3 edit (invariant #1), only session-start is core; cross-stack inserts confirmed
  byte-identical. **Verified:** new `SessionStartHazard.Tests.ps1` (19 cases, red-tested against the
  pre-D2 HEAD hook then green on both twins incl. confirmed-stale + Copilot dual-shape); build ×3 +
  freshness; validate-dist ×3; dotnet dist hook suite 0 failures across 10 files (TwinParity 40/40).
  Released via `release.ps1`. **B-22 (headless `/adopt`) is now unblocked** (its hard dependency
  B-21 D1 shipped).

- **B-37** — shipped **v0.27.1** (2026-07-16). Post-ship review of v0.27.0 (B-27 team wiki
  memory) against the locked WSD-010 spec found six defects, all fixed: GNU-only `date -d`
  failing every valid `last-verified` on macOS agents (F1); both wiki-check twins reading
  `$Root` from stdin, hanging interactive `docs-sync-check` runs (F2); locale-dependent index
  sort — bare `sort` vs culture `Sort-Object`, the B-02 skew class — pinned to byte/ordinal
  order in both twins (F3); the D4/D9 boundary-doc touchpoints that never shipped (F4); the
  `.sh` hook's Copilot-JSON wiki delivery untested (F5); and a pre-existing harness bug —
  `Invoke-Hook` decoded child stdout with the console code page, so v0.27.0's "hook suites
  green" held only on UTF-8 consoles (F6, reproduced red under ibm850, fixed by pinning UTF-8
  around the capture). Fix loop: Opus 4.8 (scripts + tests) and Sonnet 5 (docs) implementers
  under Fable 5 review; verified by red-testing the F1/F3 classes and re-running both wiki
  suites green (13 + 10) under a non-UTF-8 code page. Observation logged, NO action (locked
  design): the D6 injection-marker list hard-FAILs benign descriptions containing "instead
  of" — revisit only on consumer evidence.

- **B-32** — shipped **v0.26.5** (2026-07-15). Implemented from the LOCKED spec
  (`.claude/plans/2026-07-11-b32-context-footprint-gate-design.md`, WSD-017) via a codex
  (gpt-5.6-sol) implementer + principal-engineer review loop — five review rounds, three real
  defects found and fixed before shipping (see `meta/workspace-decisions.md` WSD-017 for the
  implementation-deltas log: baseline path retargeted to `meta/context-footprint.json`, a
  pre-existing `.ps1` hook Unicode-mangling bug the fixtures caught, and two PowerShell
  correctness bugs in the gate script itself — `Measure-Object -Property` silently returning
  zero on `[ordered]` hashtable items, and a double-array-wrap that corrupted derived totals).
  Twins `scripts/context-footprint.ps1/.sh` ship as genuinely independent implementations (not
  a delegating wrapper — the first implementer's initial cut had `.sh` shell out to `.ps1`,
  rejected on review since it defeats the CI cross-OS twin proof). **Forced an unplanned
  shipped-behavior fix**: the rendered-hook fixtures proved `dist/*/.claude/hooks/{session-start,
  route-prompt}.ps1` rendered ASCII-flattened rails (`WARNING:`/`--`) where the `.sh` twins emit
  the designed `⚠`/`—`/`→` text, **and** that redirected `.ps1` hook stdout on Windows was
  encoded with the OEM code page, silently turning `⚠/—/🔴` into `?` for every consumer who
  runs the PowerShell hooks — both fixed (UTF-8-on-redirect guard + byte-identical rendered
  text), which is why this shipped as v0.26.5 rather than landing with no version slot as the
  design anticipated. `B-34` filed for the same rendered-parity sweep on `guard`/`audit-trail`
  (out of scope here). Verified: 30-pair cross-twin render matrix, baseline generation +
  idempotent `-Update` + cross-twin byte-identical proof, full red-test matrix (freshness drift,
  twin-render-mismatch detection, WARN-ceiling reachability), all 4 hook suites + `validate-dist`
  ×3 green (the one expected pre-stamp `validate-dist` FAIL — CHANGELOG at 0.26.5 vs
  `framework-version.json` at 0.26.4 — resolved by `release.ps1`'s own stamp-then-validate
  order). Released via `release.ps1`, all gates green, pushed.
- **B-27** — shipped **v0.27.0** (2026-07-16). Implemented from the LOCKED spec
  (`.claude/plans/2026-07-04-b27-wiki-memory-design.md`, D1–D10, WSD-010 + its 2026-07-11
  monorepo-retargeting appendix) via a codex (gpt-5.6-sol) implementer + principal-engineer
  review loop — two implementation rounds, five real defects found on review and fixed before
  shipping:
  1. `wiki-check.sh`'s injection-signal character class matched the INDEX grammar's own
     mandatory em-dash under real UTF-8 collation, FAILing every syntactically valid entry —
     reproduced directly, rewritten as `LC_ALL=C` byte-exact UTF-8 matching mirroring the `.ps1`
     twin's codepoint ranges.
  2. `wiki-check.sh` didn't resolve a native Windows-style root path (exactly what the
     `Invoke-Hook` test harness passes) — fixed with separator normalization + `cygpath`.
  3. `install.ps1`'s D8 copy-if-absent fix had diverged structurally from the `.sh` twin (a full
     per-file rewrite of the whole copy loop vs. the twin's surgical `docs/`-only special case,
     an invariant #3 twin-parity violation and an oversized blast radius) — restored to match.
  4. Three separate wiki-related doc insertions (`CLAUDE.md` companion-preamble line, Common
     Tasks bullet, self-review bullet ×3 each; `ci-integration.md`'s wiki-check line ×2) had
     landed tripled/duplicated — none in the 5 verbatim-gated mirror sections, so
     `template-checks` passed clean despite it; caught only by direct file reading, deduped.
  5. The shipped `_template.md` carried a leading HTML comment not present in the locked D2
     template, breaking its own frontmatter contract (`first line must be ---`) the moment an
     entry was drafted from it literally — caught by an actual skill smoke test (draft-from-
     template, not a synthetic fixture), fixed by removing the line (principal-engineer fix,
     not round-tripped — trivial one-line deletion).
  Also confirmed and corrected: every other hook-suite failure the implementer reported
  (`AuditTrail`, `PostWriteRouting`, `RoutePrompt`, `SessionStartWiki`, `TwinParity`) was its
  sandbox's Git Bash failing to start (`CreateFileMapping ... Win32 error 5`), not a real defect
  — confirmed by rerunning every suite in a working shell, all green throughout both rounds.
  **Verified:** `build.ps1` fresh ×3 + `git status --porcelain dist/` stable; `validate-dist.ps1`
  ×3 clean (markers, JSON, `bash -n`, PS-AST, `template-checks`, `no-meta-leak`,
  `no-dead-instruction`); all 3 dists' `Invoke-HookTests.ps1` 0 failures across 9 files each
  (`WikiCheck.Tests` 11/11, `TwinParity.Tests` 40/40); meta suite (`DocTruth`,
  `InstallerContract`, `MetaHooks`, `WorkspaceBom`) green; install smoke greenfield + brownfield +
  update ×3 dists all `EXIT=0`; `docs-sync-check` ×3 clean; `wiki-check` run directly against the
  real committed `dist/*` wiki dirs (both twins agree); live guard-hook fixture (a fabricated AWS
  key in a `docs/wiki/*.md` write) blocked with exit 2, proving the generic secret-scan already
  covers wiki writes with no wiki-specific code needed; hands-on skill smoke (draft from the
  corrected template → passes wiki-check with only an expected body-level WARN → single
  entry/single INDEX line, proving the dedup-not-duplicate mechanics hold). Released via
  `release.ps1`, all gates green, pushed.
- **B-33** — done **2026-07-12**, then **REOPENED AND RE-FIXED THE SAME DAY** when tested on the
  second surface. The README fix below was **Claude-only**: given the archived repo's URL, **Copilot
  never opens the README** — it clones and runs `scripts/install.ps1` directly, and duly installed
  the frozen **v0.25.5** template straight past a STOP banner it never read. The first "verified
  red→green" claim was made on one surface of a two-surface product, which is to say it was not
  verified. **Final fix: a hard refuse-and-redirect at the top of all four frozen installer twins**
  (print the STOP, `exit 1`, copy nothing) — the one channel both surfaces demonstrably obey.
  Re-tested on Copilot against the archived URL: now redirects and installs **v0.26.4**, committed,
  correct handoff. Claude path provably unaffected (guard commit touched only `scripts/install.*`).
  Repos re-archived. Lesson in `meta/LEARNINGS.md`: *documentation is advisory; executable output is
  not.* Original README work below — still correct, just not sufficient on its own.

  Both archived
  pointer READMEs rewritten, verified, and re-archived. **The hypothesis was right and the mechanism
  was worse than filed.** Reproduced end-to-end: an agent given the old URL and *"install this
  framework into our repo"* on a clean machine read the archive banner, **rationalised past it, and
  installed the frozen v0.25.5 template** — citing the banner's own words as its warrant: *"its content
  (and the byte-for-byte-identical installer) still works, and the URL you gave me is exactly this
  repo, so I installed from it as asked."* Two causes: **(1)** the only *imperative, agent-addressed*
  text on the page was the preserved §1 (*"If you are an AI agent reading this repository, start
  here"*) telling it to run the installer **there**; the archive notice was human-voice prose the model
  felt free to weigh against it and discount. **(2)** The banner's reassurance — *"reproduces this
  template byte-for-byte … moving is an update, not a behavior change"* — was written to comfort a
  human and **armed the agent**: it reads as *the old one is equivalent, so installing it is fine.* It
  was also no longer true. Fix: banner now addresses agents first and humans second; §1 is a STOP that
  redirects; the equivalence claim is gone. Re-tested identically → installs **v0.26.3**, commits in
  the target, hands off correctly. Red→green: `0.25.5` → `0.26.3`. Repos re-archived.
  Lesson in `meta/LEARNINGS.md`.

- **B-22 (P0 design)** — done **2026-07-06** (meta-only; implementation stays open, post-merge).
  Design locked as **WSD-014**, spec at `.claude/plans/2026-07-06-b22-headless-adopt-design.md`
  (rev-2). Adversarial critique returned **RETHINK** — it proved the non-negotiable
  prompt-injection boundary forbids auto-merging untrusted content into `CLAUDE.md` (a keyword
  denylist was the only automated filter). Surfaced the constraint-1-vs-2 conflict to the
  maintainer, who chose **Path A** (prepare autonomously, human applies merges at PR review) over
  Path B (constrained auto-merge, residual risk). rev-2 folds both HIGH findings (auto-merge
  breach; embedded `/bootstrap` 3d-bis stall) + M3–M7/L8–L9: invocation via the read-and-execute
  prompt pattern (drops the spike; both surfaces), provenance-exemption for installer-archived
  originals, marker/branch lifecycle pinned, restricted tool surface for untrusted-content
  handling. Depends on B-21 D1; implementation ≥ v0.28.0 in the merged repo.
- **B-21 (P0 design)** — done **2026-07-06** (meta-only; implementation stays open, post-merge).
  Design locked as **WSD-013**, spec at `.claude/plans/2026-07-06-b21-reviewer-profile-design.md`.
  Re-scoped after finding two of the three original fixes already partly shipped; three deltas
  designed (D1 judgment checklist into PR/commit, D2 session-start hazard resurface, D3 rendered
  ladder legend). Adversarially critiqued (LOCK WITH AMENDMENTS): 2 HIGH + 4 MEDIUM + 4 LOW
  folded — notably D2's date mechanism rewritten to real interval math with an ISO-pin on
  3d-bis, D1 given a real landing site + durable `<!-- DEFAULTED -->` trace, and a corrected
  (false) B-27 dependency. Implementation is B-21's remaining open work, ≥ v0.28.0 in the merged
  repo. The B-21 entry above carries the pointer.
- **B-31** — shipped **v0.25.5** (2026-07-06). Angular's `.claude/settings.windows.json` was
  missing the `audit-trail.ps1` PostToolUse registration — a gap the B-14 port missed (it wired
  `settings.json` + `hooks.json` but not the PS-5.1 fallback), found by the B-25 adversarial
  review. PS-5.1-fallback Angular consumers silently had no audit log while the v0.25.3
  CHANGELOG claimed one. Fixed (registration line byte-matches dotnet), and `check-lockstep`
  gained a §5 `settings.json`/`settings.windows.json` registration-parity gate
  (`event|matcher|command` sets; `_comment` ignored) with a planted-drift self-test
  (`CheckLockstep.Tests.ps1` B-31 case, red-before-green: the new gate first failed the old
  synthetic fixture, then 5/5). Released via release.ps1, all gates green, both repos pushed.
- **B-25 (decision + refresh)** — done **2026-07-06** (meta + the B-31 release). D1–D7 signed
  off (**WSD-012**); `MERGE-MIGRATION-PLAN.md` refreshed against v0.25.5 (fresh §1 evidence:
  138 files/repo, 128 common, 51 EOL-normalized-identical, 10+10 stack-only; new §2.5
  machinery-disposition table; composer twin policy resolving the WSD-005 collision; honest D3;
  D7 meta-layer fate; freeze scope; archive/tag moved after Phase 6; abort rule; freeze-tag
  fidelity baseline). Adversarial review pass reproduced every measured number and surfaced
  B-31 (fixed) + the stale-execution-sections and phase-ordering hazards (folded in).
  Execution continues as **B-25-EXEC**. WSD-010 + the B-27 design doc carry retarget notes
  (v0.27.0, merged repo).
- **B-19 · B-24 · B-28 · B-30** — shipped **v0.25.4** (2026-07-05, the "small-items sweep"; all
  gates green via `release.ps1`, both repos pushed). Per item:
  - **B-28**: `build-architecture-html` twins now byte-identical — `.ps1` gained the missing head
    newline, writes LF-only BOM-less UTF-8 via .NET (the content cmdlets added BOM + host EOLs, a
    third divergence beyond the two the entry named), and both twins stamp the neutral `{sh,ps1}`
    generator name. New `tests/hooks/BuildArchitectureHtml.Tests.ps1` (byte-identical both repos;
    red-before-green: 4 failures pre-fix → 5/5 green; fixture byte-compare + join-symptom guard).
    Both repos' `architecture.html` regenerated **with the `.ps1`** — surgical diff (generator
    line + sha + content only), proving parity in real use.
  - **B-30**: `test-critic` row added to the §5 agents table in both repos + HTML regen (filed by
    the WSD-011 adversarial review; rode the release, so B-11's no-version question was moot).
  - **B-24**: **premise correction** — the entry's "installer fallback is also PowerShell" was
    stale: `install.sh:120-127` already rewires Claude Code hooks to the bash twins when the
    installing box lacks pwsh. The real residual gap is *team inheritance*: committed
    `settings.json` carries the installing machine's wiring, so a teammate without that shell
    gets no hooks silently (and the manual-copy Quick Start path never rewires). Documented as a
    README "Hook prerequisite" callout in both repos.
  - **B-19**: (a) `post-write` trigger breadth — dotnet accepts
    `.cs|.csproj|.sln|.props|.targets|.razor|.cshtml`; angular accepts `.ts` under `src/` plus
    `tsconfig*.json` anywhere (tsconfig bypasses the `src/` gate; `angular.json`/`package.json`
    excluded by design — `tsc` can't validate them, a trigger there is false comfort). All four
    twins + header comments; filter reach verified via `bash -x` trace matrix (12 inputs, all as
    designed — full build-failure path not exercisable on this box: no dotnet CLI, no
    node_modules fixture; hook suites 2×7 files, 0 failures). (b) README versioning section now
    points at the installer's real update mode instead of the `/framework-update` vaporware.
    (c) Boy Scout dedup semantics documented in `enforcement-surfaces.md` (hash of sorted finding
    set; silence = already flagged, not resolved). Bonus: fixed stale "audit trail — dotnet only
    (B-14)" row in both repos' `enforcement-surfaces.md` (missed by the B-14 release).

- **B-14** — shipped **v0.25.3** (2026-07-05). Ported the `audit-trail` PostToolUse hook to Angular
  in dual-repo lockstep. Angular now carries `.claude/hooks/audit-trail.ps1/.sh` (faithful mirror of
  dotnet — byte-identical except the artifact skip: `node_modules`/`dist`/`.angular`/`coverage`
  instead of `obj`/`bin`; UTF-8 BOM on the `.ps1`), a byte-identical seed `.claude/ai-audit.log`,
  the `PostToolUse` registration in `.claude/settings.json`, and the `postToolUse` entry
  (timeoutSec 10, no matcher) in `.github/hooks/hooks.json`. CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md Registers lines
  gained the ai-audit sentence. Added `tests/hooks/AuditTrail.Tests.ps1` (byte-identical in both
  repos, stack-agnostic behavior + static skip/append guards, red-before-green verified);
  TwinParity auto-covers the new twin. **Removed all three `check-lockstep.ps1` audit-trail
  exceptions** (the two `$onlyInDotnet` entries + the §4 hooks.json `-notmatch 'audit-trail'`
  special-case) — the gate now enforces full parity and passes clean. Delivered by Sonnet against
  an Opus plan (`.claude/plans/2026-07-04-b14-port-audit-trail-angular.md`); adversarial review
  caught a missing trailing newline on the Angular `.ps1` (fixed → now differs from the dotnet twin
  only in the skip line). Verified: release.ps1 ran every gate green (template-checks ×2, hook
  suites ×2 with AuditTrail 10/10, check-lockstep, meta suite), both repos committed + pushed.
- **B-12** — **already resolved; no change needed** (verified **2026-07-04**, meta-only). The audit
  inspected only the *root* `.gitignore` and missed the tracked, colocated **`.claude/.gitignore`**
  (present in both repos since v0.4.0), whose `.state/` line already ignores
  `.claude/.state/last-build-ts`. Evidence: `git check-ignore -v .claude/.state/last-build-ts` →
  `.claude/.gitignore:2:.state/` in both repos; no `.state` file tracked in either. Greenfield
  `install.sh` smoke into a temp dir confirmed the installer **ships** `.claude/.gitignore` and,
  after simulating the `post-write` stamp, git ignores it. **Correction to the audit's suggested
  approach:** adding `.claude/.state/` to the *root* `.gitignore` would have been wrong — the
  installer excludes the root `.gitignore` from the consumer copy (`$metaFiles` in
  `scripts/install.ps1`/`.sh`), so the nested `.claude/.gitignore` is the *only* vehicle that
  reaches consumers, and it is already correct.

> **Post-hoc review 2026-07-04 (Fable):** the P1 (v0.25.1) and P2 (v0.25.2) bands were
> independently re-verified — all gates re-run green (template-checks ×2, check-lockstep, hook

- **B-11** — done **2026-07-04** (docs accuracy, **no version/CHANGELOG** — user-approved: invariant
  #7 is scoped to shipped *behavior*). Corrected every human-facing bootstrap pass-count reference to
  match each repo's `bootstrap.md`. **Scope was larger than the audit stated** — the drift was in
  *both* repos (angular said A1–A6/"six" but runs A1–A7), and the adversarial review found two the
  audit + plan missed: both repos' `.github/prompts/rebootstrap.prompt.md`, and angular's
  `bootstrap.md:2` frontmatter description ("eight"→"seven"). Files: dotnet — `README.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (×2 rows), `.github/prompts/rebootstrap.prompt.md`, regenerated
  `docs/architecture.html`; angular — same four + `.claude/commands/bootstrap.md:2`. **HTML regenerated
  with the `.sh` twin, not `.ps1`** (see B-28 — the `.ps1` twin emits divergent bytes and would have
  injected a generator-comment flip + `<script>`-tag change into the diff). Verified: exhaustive grep
  sweep (zero stale counts, both repos), content-only HTML diffs, all gates green (template-checks ×2,
  check-lockstep, hook suites 0 failures, meta suite). Canonical `commands/bootstrap.md` bodies,
  `bootstrap.prompt.md`, and the `bootstrap-pass` agents were already correct and left untouched.
- **B-10** — done **2026-07-04** (meta-only, no version/CHANGELOG). Added UTF-8 BOMs to 3 offenders (`.claude/scripts/check-lockstep.ps1`, `release.ps1`, `.claude/hooks/tests/CheckLockstep.Tests.ps1`). New `.claude/hooks/tests/WorkspaceBom.Tests.ps1` recurrence gate: asserts all root `.claude/` `.ps1` files carry a BOM on every meta-suite run, vacuous-pass guard included. Meta suite wired into `release.ps1` so the gate runs at every future release.
- **B-13** — done **2026-07-04** (maintainer memory, no repo change). `hook-output-semantics.md`
  updated: "shipped docs stale" removed; now records the v0.25.1 live-canary results (CLI 1.0.68
  consumes `userPromptSubmitted` additionalContext, does NOT consume `postToolUse`; folder-trust
  prerequisite; VS Code consumption still unverified). `self-sufficiency-roadmap.md` and
  `fable-exit-backlog.md` refreshed in the same pass.
- **B-02** — shipped **v0.25.1**. `post-write.ps1` epoch switched to
  `[DateTimeOffset]::UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds()` (both repos), killing the PS 5.1 comma-decimal
  `OverflowException` and the UTC/local twin-skew. Added `tests/hooks/PostWrite.Tests.ps1`
  (host-independent, red-before-green; crash reproduced under de-DE during the fix).
- **B-01** (minimum doc-honesty fix) — shipped **v0.25.1**. `enforcement-surfaces.md` gained the
  shell-write caveat on the Write hard-blocks row; `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` Verification-Rule-7
  parenthetical scoped to editor/file writes. *Optional guard hardening (register on the terminal
  tool + content-sniff) was **deferred** by decision — file as a follow-on; false-positive risk +
  needs its own fixtures and a workspace-decision record.*
- **B-03** — shipped **v0.25.1**. Live-verified via sentinel canary on **Copilot CLI 1.0.68**:
  `userPromptSubmitted` additionalContext **is** consumed; `postToolUse` additionalContext is
  **not** consumed by the model; repo hooks fire **only after folder trust** (no non-interactive
  trust flag). Updated `enforcement-surfaces.md` Status notes + corrected the false
  "consumes postToolUse feedback" comment in the `post-write` twins. **Follow-ons this surfaced:**
  the `post-write`/`audit-trail` Copilot postToolUse leg is dead → fold into the B-08 matrix rows
  and the B-09 post-write demotion; the folder-trust prerequisite → `framework-doctor` (B-16).
  VS Code agent-mode consumption still unverified (canary covered the CLI only).
- **B-09** — shipped **v0.25.2**. Fixed the `post-write.ps1` `$tn=$null` misrouting (pre-declared
  `$tn=''` so malformed/env-fallback build failures hit Claude's exit-2 branch, matching the `.sh`
  twin). Added `tests/hooks/PostWriteRouting.Tests.ps1` (static `$tn` guard + build-free twin
  agreement). Note: post-write's *build-failure* routing can't be exercised in the byte-identical
  `tests/hooks` dir (stack-specific `.cs`-vs-`.ts` build); boy-scout decision-output likewise — both
  covered only for robustness there. B-02's epoch bug (the other divergence B-09 named) shipped in 0.25.1.
- **B-04** — shipped **v0.25.2** (maintainer gate). `check-lockstep` enumerates the union of both
  repos for every IDENTICAL class (missing-in-dotnet now fails too), throw-safe on missing dirs.
  Self-test: `.claude/hooks/tests/CheckLockstep.Tests.ps1` (green control + planted angular-only file).
- **B-06** — shipped **v0.25.2** (maintainer gate). Replaced the static `$sharedSkills` list with a
  computed rule: any skill present in both repos is shared-and-required; only stack-specific skills are
  declared. `enforce-standards` now enforced. Self-tested.
- **B-05** — shipped **v0.25.2**. Unified `post-write` `timeoutSec` to 120 (angular was 60; WSD-009)
  and added a structured `hooks.json` registration-parity gate to `check-lockstep` (audit-trail the
  one dotnet-only exception). Self-tested (planted timeout drift).
- **B-07** — shipped **v0.25.2**. `template-checks.ps1/.sh` gained an EOL-normalized `.claude/skills`
  ↔ `.github/skills` mirror gate (runs in both repos' `template-ci.yml`). Trap recorded in LEARNINGS:
  the gate must EOL-normalize (core.autocrlf) and `[IO.File]::ReadAllText` needs absolute paths
  (process-CWD ≠ `Set-Location`).
- **B-08** — shipped **v0.25.2**. `enforcement-surfaces.md` gained three capability rows (build/
  type-check feedback, Boy Scout stop-nudge, audit trail) encoding the B-03 live findings — Copilot
  does not consume `postToolUse` additionalContext (post-write feedback not surfaced), while
  `audit-trail`'s file side-effect still fires.
