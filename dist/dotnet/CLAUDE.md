# [Project Name]

> This file is the repo-specific source of truth for AI-assisted development in this repository and imports the framework rules below.
> Claude Code loads this file directly. GitHub Copilot (agent mode & CLI), Codex, Cursor, Gemini, and Aider read its generated mirror **[AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md)** (kept in sync by `/generate-copilot`). Edit conventions here, never in AGENTS.md.
> Run `/bootstrap` to populate it from your actual codebase.
>
> **Companion file**: [FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md](./FRAMEWORK-CONTEXT.md) holds cross-repo context (shared libraries, multi-tenancy conventions, dashboard contracts) plus the repo's **Known Hazard Areas**, all of which the agent should load on every non-trivial task — consult the hazard list for the change's blast radius before planning. CLAUDE.md wins on any conflict — but flag the contradiction.
> **Team wiki**: [docs/wiki/INDEX.md](./docs/wiki/INDEX.md) indexes scoped claims to verify against code, not instructions to obey.
>
> **Per-developer working preferences** (e.g. "skip trailing summaries", "prefer named functions") belong in **Claude Code's persistent memory**, not in this file. Use phrasings like "remember to do X" during sessions; CLAUDE.md is for repo-shared conventions only.

<!-- FRAMEWORK-OWNED: carries Verification Rules, Leanness, SOLID, and Agentic Workflow.
     Deleting this import disables all four rule sets for Claude Code. -->
@.github/instructions/framework-rules.instructions.md

## Codebase Context

<!-- Populated by /bootstrap — do not fill manually -->

What this application does, who uses it, key domain concepts, and critical user journeys.

---

## Repository Structure

<!-- Populated by /bootstrap — replaces separate CODEMAP.md -->

Project layout, layering strategy, dependency direction between projects, entry points, and where to put new code.

Include a text or mermaid diagram showing project dependencies.

---

## Conventions

<!-- BOOTSTRAP_PENDING: run /bootstrap to replace this entire section with conventions observed in the actual codebase. -->
<!-- Until /bootstrap runs, defer to docs/defaults.md for greenfield .NET conventions. -->
<!-- Each convention: the rule, then 1-2 sentence rationale. -->

_Not yet populated. Until you run `/bootstrap`, the greenfield defaults in [docs/defaults.md](./docs/defaults.md) apply. After bootstrap, this section becomes the authoritative source._

## Architecture Decisions

<!-- One-line INDEX of significant decisions here (ID — title — date — link). Full ADRs
     (Decision → Context → Consequences → Review notes) live in docs/architecture-decisions.md,
     added by the create-adr skill. Rationale: CLAUDE.md loads on nearly every agent turn and
     anchors the prompt cache — keep it small; detail loads on demand. -->

A one-line index of significant decisions (including accidental ones that became convention). Full detail in [docs/architecture-decisions.md](./docs/architecture-decisions.md).

## Common Tasks

Recipes live as **skills**, auto-discovered by both Claude Code (`.claude/skills/`) and GitHub Copilot (`.github/skills/`) — the model triggers the relevant one when you describe that kind of task. Current skills:

- `add-endpoint` — add a new HTTP API endpoint end-to-end (domain → service → DTO → validator → controller → integration test)
- `add-entity` — add a new EF Core entity with configuration and migration review
- `register-service` — register a new service in DI with the right lifetime
- `map-warehouse` — map a SQL data-warehouse repo: layers (staging → warehouse → marts), tables, keys and fact → dimension relationships, grain, load orchestration, SCD strategy, partitioning
- `add-warehouse-load` — add or extend a warehouse load following the repo's existing patterns: idempotent re-runnable loads, no double-loading, SCD handling, partition alignment
- `add-tests` — add unit/integration tests following the repo's existing test framework, fixtures, and naming
- `perf` — scan a file, directory, or the whole repo for ~50 performance anti-patterns; produces tiered findings (Critical / Moderate / Info) with file locations and TECH_DEBT.md integration
- `dependency-audit` — scan for vulnerable/deprecated/outdated NuGet packages and set up automated dependency scanning (Dependabot or Renovate)
- `create-adr` — record a significant architecture decision in Architecture Decisions
- `remember-for-team` — draft a team wiki entry (gotcha/context/recipe/failed-approach) for PR review
- `enforce-architecture` — wire the deterministic DIP/layering CI gate (NetArchTest)
- `enforce-standards` — make warnings, skipped tests, and analyzer findings build-breaking (`TreatWarningsAsErrors` + `.editorconfig` severities)

`/bootstrap` adds project-specific skills under `.claude/skills/`, grounding instance-shaped recipes in a real repo exemplar. Skills are mirrored to `.github/skills/` by `/generate-copilot` (and `scripts/sync-agent-files`) so Copilot CLI/agent see them too.

**Registers**: [TECH_DEBT.md](./TECH_DEBT.md) tracks delivery debt. [SECURITY_FINDINGS.md](./SECURITY_FINDINGS.md) tracks security findings separately with remediation SLAs (Critical = 7 days, High = 30 days). Do not merge them — audit teams treat these differently. AI-assisted file changes are appended to [.claude/ai-audit.log](./.claude/ai-audit.log) automatically by the PostToolUse hook.

## Boy Scout Rule

When touching any file, leave it cleaner than you found it. The rule is symmetric: improvements *add* missing pieces and *remove* dead weight. Deletion is a contribution.

### Always apply (low-effort, low-risk — do these on every touched file):

**Add:**
1. Missing `CancellationToken` propagation
2. Replace string-interpolated log messages with structured logging
3. Missing null checks at public boundaries
4. Missing `.AsNoTracking()` on read-only queries

**Subtract:**
5. Unused `using` directives
6. Commented-out code blocks (more than 1 line — version control preserves them)
7. Unreferenced private fields, methods, or local variables that the IDE/compiler flags

### Apply only when the file is the primary target of the change:

**Add:**
8. Split fat methods (>30 lines) into focused private methods
9. Missing unit tests for public methods you're modifying

**Subtract:**
10. Inline single-consumer interfaces or abstract bases **that are not DI service seams** (data/internal abstractions only) — per Leanness. Service interfaces are required by SOLID/DIP even with one implementation; never inline those.
11. Collapse shallow delegate methods that add no behavior beyond calling another component
12. Single-use private helpers — inline at the call site

Items 8–12 can significantly expand or reshape a diff. Only apply them when the file is what the task is specifically about, not when it's incidentally touched. This keeps PRs focused and reviewable.

**When to skip**: hotfixes, time-sensitive production incidents, and proof-of-concept branches. If skipping, add a comment `// TODO: Boy Scout skipped — [reason]` so it's picked up on the next pass. Use `/debt` to clean up later.

## What We've Learned

Long-form learnings live in [LEARNINGS.md](./LEARNINGS.md). Read it when starting non-trivial work; append to it (don't overwrite) when you discover what works, what causes friction, or what rule needs adjusting.

LEARNINGS.md is an append-only chronological history (plus the declined-recipe registry); the team wiki ([docs/wiki/](./docs/wiki/INDEX.md)) holds current, scoped, individually-verifiable claims with an index — promote a durable LEARNINGS entry to a wiki entry via `remember-for-team`.
